The Launcher will get all its info from the API

The Main window will have a list of all games that are supported.
Those will be displayed in a Grid with theyr image and have info shown on it.

When clicked it will change to the game page which will show some standard info
like where it came from (Steam, Uplay, Browser,...) Its latest Version, If its still publiclly available,
The Team that made the servers, a PATCH and START Button.

The launcher will then try to search for the game if its steam and if it cant find it or
its not from steam open a window for the user to open the main folder of the game.

After that the Client will run its file logic to patch the game.

If the game is not publically available anymore it will download it.
